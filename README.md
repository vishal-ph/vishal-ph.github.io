> I am a Quantum Computing Research Engineer at Entropica Labs, Singapore. I rely on Quantum Algorithms (mostly VQAs) to benchmark present-generation Quantum Computers and constantly pursue their practical applications for real-world problems. I have obtained my Masters of Science education in Physics from the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU Munich) and my Bachelors of Technology in Engineering Physics from Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi). Outside work I enjoy learning about linguistics and history of human migrations and cultures.
