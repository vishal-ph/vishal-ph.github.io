# Hi, I am Vishal!

> I am a Quantum Computing Researcher at Entropica Labs, Singapore. I rely on Quantum Algorithms (mostly VQAs) to benchmark present-generation Quantum Computers and constantly pursue their practical applications for real-world problems. I have obtained my academic training in Physics from The Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU Munich) and Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi) with a Masters in Physics and a Bachelors in Engineering Physics respectively. I am a practising minimalist of ownership
